# AIRE PWA - Sprint Log

## Current Mission:
* [ ] **Mission 8: Offline Support**
    * [ ] Add offline detection and messaging
    * [ ] Implement service worker for PWA offline capabilities

## Backlog (Future Missions):
* [ ] **Mission 9: Kairos (AI Mirror)** - Deferred to post-MVP
* [ ] **Mission 10: Enhanced Analytics** - Post-MVP feature
* [ ] **Mission 11: Social Features** - Post-MVP feature

## Active Blockers:
* None.

## Known Issues:
* **ImproveScreen API endpoint bug**: Fixed - changed `/api/cycles/list` to `/api/cycles/lists` (endpoint mismatch)
* **Login "invalid credentials"**: Password reset works but normal login shows error - needs investigation

## Completed Missions:

    * [x] Purged all Telegram Mini App dependencies
    * [x] Installed Supabase libraries
    * [x] Initialized shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS

    * [x] Database table created with correct schema (`user_id` uuid, RLS enabled)
    * **Approach:** NEW JWKS (RSA public/private keys) - more secure, supports key rotation

    * **Note:** Kairos (AI Mirror) integration deferred to post-MVP

* **Mission 6 (Part 1): Resonance Engine** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    * [x] Created keyword matching utility (`api/lib/resonance.ts`)
    * [x] Created Resonance API endpoint (`api/resonance/query.ts`) with JWT auth

    * [x] Updated CommitScreen to show contextual improvement suggestions
    * [x] All functionality working with debounced search-as-you-type

* **Mission 7: Notification System** ✅ **COMPLETE**

    * **Implementation Details:**
      - Uses Vercel's native CRON_SECRET for cron authentication (simpler and more secure)
      - 5-minute time window for matching user preferred notification times
      - HTML email template with deep-link to `/prime` route
      - Upsert pattern for user preferences (allows updates)
      - Skip option available for users who want to defer setup
    * **⚠️ User Actions Required:**
      - Run SQL script in Supabase to create `user_preferences` table
      - Create Resend account and add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Vercel
      - Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel (Vercel can auto-generate or set custom value)
      - Optionally set `PWA_URL` if different from default
